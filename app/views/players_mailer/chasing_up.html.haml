  Hi,
  We're still short of players, so if you can play, please click the links below, or if you know someone else, add them in...
  We've currently got 8 players, so we need two more. If we can;t get them by lunchtime tomorrow, I'll have to cancel the game, which would be a shame

%p
  = link_to "I'm available", game_game_player_change_status_url(@game_player.game, @game_player, status: :available)
%p
  = link_to "Sorry, I can't make it", game_game_player_change_status_url(@game_player.game, @game_player, status: :unavailable)

%p
  Time: 
  = @game.time.strftime("%H:%M")
%p
  Date:
  = @game.date.strftime("%d-%m-%Y")
%p
  Location:
  = @game.location
%p
  = link_to 'Game page', game_path(@game)
